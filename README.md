# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description

This project was designed to simulate an E-Commerce application's backend functionality. It includes a database connection with routes to modify the contents of the database.

## Installation

Download the directory from the repository, and in the command-line, run 'npm i' to install dependencies.

## Usage

To run the application, create a .env file and copy the example with your information into it. Then seed the database by typing 'node seeds' into the command-line. After that, just run 'npm start', and the application will be live. Using Insomnia (or any app that can test apis), run any of the routes found in the routes file.

This video demonstrates how to use the application properly:
